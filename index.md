## Biography
---
I am a PhD student of [PRISDL](https://ucassdl.cn/) in the School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Qixiang Ye](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0007279?language=en). I got a B.E. degree in Electronic Information School at Wuhan University, Wuhan in June 2018.

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning, specifically for few-shot learning and semantic segmentation.
